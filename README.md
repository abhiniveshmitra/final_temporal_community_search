# Road Network Community Detection with Gravity-Based Assignment
Overview
Our project focuses on modeling and optimizing road networks by representing them as graphs. This approach allows us to analyze traffic patterns and enhance route planning efficiently.

What We Are Doing
We are implementing the Road Network Community Detection with Gravity-Based Assignment algorithm, which aims to:

Identify Communities:

Group road segments into communities based on traffic patterns, node weights, and physical distances.
Optimize Route Planning:

Precompute important metrics to speed up route calculations and reduce computational overhead.
Key Concepts
Graph Representation:
Road networks are modeled as graphs where intersections and road segments are nodes and edges, respectively.

Community Detection:
Similar to social networks, we group nodes (road segments) into communities based on their connectivity and traffic flow.

Betweenness Centrality:
To optimize routes, we calculate betweenness centrality for nodes to identify critical bridge nodes connecting different communities.

Approach
Community Formation:

Compute connection strengths using traffic density, node weights, and distances.
Assign nodes to communities based on these strengths.
Precompute Metrics:

Calculate and store betweenness centrality at peak traffic times.
Identify and store bridge nodes between communities.
Shortest Path Calculation:

Use Dijkstraâ€™s or A* algorithm to find the shortest path:
From the source to a bridge node.
Across bridge nodes between communities.
From the bridge node to the destination.
Benefits
Efficiency:
By precomputing and storing key metrics, we reduce the computational complexity compared to recalculating them on-the-fly.

Improved Route Planning:
Integrating community-based shortest paths with inter-community connections enhances navigation across the road network.
